# Abstract

This project initially aimed to utilize NLP techniques to assist non-experts in composing journalistic articles on various subjects, including text summarization, question answering, and named entity recognition (NER). However, due to the complexity of creating a versatile system, the project's focus has narrowed to a specific NER task related to earthquake prediction. The paper explores the challenges of custom NER tasks and the potential of few-shot learning (FSL) to overcome the need for extensive labeled data. By combining BERT's pre-trained language capabilities with FSL, the paper demonstrates how NER models can excel in specialized domains. The contributions of this paper include introducing BERT for custom NER tasks and providing insights into the practical steps involved in implementing such an approach, from data collection and annotation to model training and evaluation.
