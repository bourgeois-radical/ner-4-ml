# Abstract

This project initially aimed to utilize NLP techniques (such as text summarization, question answering, NER etc.) to assist non-experts in composing journalistic articles on various subjects. However, due to the complexity of creating a versatile system, the project's focus has narrowed to a specific NER task, namely to identifying ML algotithms/architectures in the papers on earthquake prediction. The term-paper explores the challenges of custom NER tasks and the potential of few-shot learning (FSL) to overcome the need for extensive labeled data. By combining BERT's pre-trained language capabilities with FSL, the term-paper demonstrates how NER can be performed in specialized domains. The contributions of this term-paper include introducing BERT for custom NER tasks and providing insights into the practical steps involved in implementing such an approach, from data collection and annotation to model training and evaluation.
